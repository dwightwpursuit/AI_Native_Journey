## About
My aim with this repository is to document my learning path and practical implementations of AI-native concepts. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Agents and Autonomous Systems
- AI-powered Development Tools (like Cursor!)
- Generative AI applications
- Integrating AI with traditional software development.

## Goals
- To build a solid understanding of AI-native principles.
- To develop practical AI-powered applications.
- To share insights and code examples with the community.
- To continuously learn and adapt to the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

## Current Projects
*(Leave this section empty for now, or add a placeholder for future projects)*
- Project 1: [Link to project's folder/description]
- Project 2: ...

## Technologies Used
- Python (primary language)
- Specific AI frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, TensorFlow, PyTorch - *add as you use them*)
- AI Tools (e.g., Cursor, GitHub Copilot - *add as you use them*)
- Git & GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
