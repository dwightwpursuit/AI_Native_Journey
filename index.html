            Hello,
            <br><br>
            Welcome to the beginning of my incredible AI-Native journey to learning how to code. This journey is uniquely mine because: It's exciting to embark on this path with no previous coding knowledge, empowered by AI's evolving capabilities. I’m entering the world of coding as an AI-Native, ready to effectively learn and utilize AI to assist me as a beginner. My aspiration is clear: My goal to build projects using AI-powered tools like Cursor is truly inspiring.
            <br><br>
            This will indeed be an interesting journey, growing from knowing absolutely nothing about coding to becoming an application builder with AI by my side.
            <br><br>
            Let's begin!
